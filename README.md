## COMPONENT EXPLANNATION
### 1.ARDUINO - The Arduino Uno is an open-source microcontroller board. The board is consists of Digital pins, analog pins, reset button, power socket and other connecting pins. Pins connect directly with electronic components by wire as LED, Resistor, sensors,etc. or with the help of expanison board as DC motor with driver module. It is coded with Arduino software with help of C/C++ using special rules of code structuring.
### 2.LED - A light-emiitting diode(LED) is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it. It has polarity(+ve and -ve).
### 3.Buzzer - A buzzer is an audio signalling device, which may be mechanical, piezoelectric, etc. We can use it as a alarm with arduino circuit as an IR sensor detect any object then it will be given input and sound will be there.
